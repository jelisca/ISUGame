ABOUT THE GAME:
This game is a reaction-based circle game with inspirations drawn from the japanese rhythm game taiko.

PREREQUISITE DOWNLOADS/POSSIBLE CAUSES FOR ERROR:
This game uses pygame to run everything. To download pygame, you may use the following guide: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
Python is also required to run the game.
Make sure to download pygame in the same directory as the game file. Also make sure that the file "Coconut_Mall.ogg" stays in the same file as the game file. 

PLAYING THE GAME:
There are two main objects in the game: notes and a target. THe target is the larger center pink circle while notes are the smaller moving circles of various colours. 
During gameplay, notes will appear randomly on one of four sides (left, right, buttom, and top). Their speed will increase the longer a round lasts.
The goal of each round is to make notes disappear as close to the center of the target as possible. Doing so will reward points.
To make a note disappear, the player must use the arrow or WASD keys to the correspondng side that the note is appoaching. 
For example, if a note is coming from the left of the target, the player must press the 'A' or LEFT arrow key to successfullly make it disappear. 
Missing a not will result in a game over.
This includes clicking its key outside of the target or not pressing any key and letting it past the target.
Selecting a higher difficulty in the main menu will increase the number of notes present at a time, with the minimum being 2 and maximum being 4.
